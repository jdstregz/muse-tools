# Muse Tools
By Josh

This is a web app I created using the Spotify Web Api example authentication project. This originally started as a way for me to practice web development, but I think some of these tools can be helpful. I'm focusing on three main functionalities:

1. Search Details: Obviously we can all look up songs, but what isn't very known to many people is that Spotify actually provides certain metrics with songs in their database. Things like key, tempo, danceability, energy, acousticness, etc. This search shows that data. 

2. Playlist Generation: Spotify provides a lot of awesome playlists, but what if I wanted to make a playlist using very particular criteria? Say I wanted to make a playlist of songs that had a danceability rating above 90? What about an acoustic playlist of songs between the years of 2001 and 2002 but also a tempo above 200? Let's make some funky playlists. 

3. Group Listen: There are too many times where I find myself sending spotify links to my friends over various chats. What if my friends and I could easily join a group queue and listen to the same music. 


Future Improvements:

Search:
- Show charting for values that are provided throughout the sequences of the songs
- Incorperate a lyrics API (Genius?)
- Allow Search Filtering
- Allow Pagination

Playlist Gen:
- Incorperate Library Downloads/Likes
- Actually finish this lol

Group Listen:
- Requires a seperate authentication system
- Database of queues and songs

Potential Future Ideas:
- mix other music providers in
- chat features
